FormsByAir will now automatically scan all form attachments for malware including viruses using [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) immediately after submission.

If a document containing an infected file is detected, the document will be quarantined and account administrators will be notified by email. Quarantined documents can then be viewed and deleted in our portal.
