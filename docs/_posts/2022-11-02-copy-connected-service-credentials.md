title: Copy connected service credentials
type: platform
---

We've added the ability to copy the credentials for a connected service from Production to Test and vice versa where there is no requirement for these to be different.

We'll also display an arrow icon next to each service to indicate that Production and Test are using the same credentials.

See [Form Status]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/status/) for information about how form status relates to Production/Test credentials.
