title: Phone number validation
type: platform

We've updated phone number validation so that error messages for invalid **International Mobile** numbers are no longer dismissable.

We previously allowed form fillers to continue with invalid mobile numbers to manage potential false positives.

The problem is that mobile numbers are often captured so they can be used for text messaging, and without strict validation, too many people mistakenly enter landline numbers.

Errors for **International** phone number validation (where landline or mobile numbers are acceptable) can still be ignored.
