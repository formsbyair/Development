title: Display content lists
type: platform
---

We've made the following changes to bullet and numbered lists for **Display Content** and **Terms** elements in both form view and auto-generated Word/PDF output.

The intent is to make it easier to display complex text or legal terms in a clean format without needing custom styling in the form, or a custom template for Word/PDF output.

* Bullets and numbers are now centered within their margin to appear less "gappy"
* We've reduced the vertical space between each item slightly
* We now support up to 5 levels of indentation
