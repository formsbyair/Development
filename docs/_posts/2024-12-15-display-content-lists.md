title: Display content lists
type: platform
---

We've made the following changes to bullet and numbered lists for **Display Content** and **Terms** elements in both form view and auto-generated Word/PDF output.

The intent is to display complex text or legal terms cleanly without needing custom styling in the form, or a custom template for Word/PDF output.

* The bullet or number is now centered within it's margin to appear less "gappy"
* The vertical space between each item has been reduced slightly
* We now support up to 4 levels of indentation
