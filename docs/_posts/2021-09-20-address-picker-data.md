title: Address Picker data

We've updated our default Google Places Address Picker to bring it in to alignment with our other Address Lookup services.

It will now store the component parts of an address in a common address model, which can be accessed with tag properties both in-form and in integration templates e.g. &lt;&lt;Address.City&gt;&gt;

See [Address Model](https://formsbyair.com/swagger/ui/index?urls.primaryName=schema%2Fintegrations%2Fswagger.json%3Fv%3D101)
