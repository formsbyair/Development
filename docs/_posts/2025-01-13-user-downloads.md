"User download" file integrations have previously only been available *after* form submission to download a copy of what was submitted.

We've now extended these integrations to support "portal" style forms, which typically *display* information, often from an external data source.

If you configure a User Download integration for a form with **Submission Mode = None** we'll now automatically render a Download button at the bottom of the page. Clicking the button will trigger the form to save, and then immediately return the corresponding file.

In making this change we've updated the original file purpose description from "Download on submission" to "User Download" to cover the extended capability.
