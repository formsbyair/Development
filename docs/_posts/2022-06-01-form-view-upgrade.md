title: Form View Upgrade
type: platform
---

We've now applied the first update for our form view engine as mentioned in the previous post. Any form you open from our portal will now use the new view engine.

Forms opened on public links e.g. https://your-company.formsbyair.com/... will continue to use the existing view engine for now. Please check your forms and advise us if you notice any issues.

We're planning to update the view engine for all form links and users on **Wednesday 15th June 2022.**
