title: Staged Submission without workflow
type: feature
---

Staged Submission is now supported for forms that don't use workflow. This may be helpful for forms that require progressive review and completion by multiple external users.

When a stage is submitted, the document will advance to the next stage and revert to **Saved** status. Emails can be triggered at each stage to notify the relevant party to access the document and complete their stage.
