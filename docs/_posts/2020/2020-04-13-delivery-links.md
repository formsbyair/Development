FormsByAir will now store the absolute URL for a record or file that we've created or updated in an external system.

Delivery References on the Document Information page will now appear as hyperlinks where this is available.

In addition, you can access delivery links using the new system tag &lt;&lt;[DocumentDeliveryLink]&gt;&gt; which can be used to include links in email notifications.
