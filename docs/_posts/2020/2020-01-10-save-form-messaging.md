title: Save form messaging
type: platform

The confirmation message that appears when you **Save** a form has been updated to advise that you can continue to make changes and save again or submit, it is also hidden automatically when/if further changes are made.

The option to automatically display a saved form when you open the corresponding blank form has been removed. This was rarely used, and represented an unnecessary security risk.
