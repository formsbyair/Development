title: Repeater title tags
type: platform

Repeaters using the **Auto** format option would previously display values for the first several elements within each repeater alongside the title when collapsed.

This was useful for previewing and differenting data for multiple, collapsed repeaters, but there was no control over which values should appear.

This "auto preview" feature has been removed. You can now use tags in the Title property of a repeater to refer to specific child elements (within each repeater) and parent elements.
