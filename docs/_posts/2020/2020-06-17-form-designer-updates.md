In order to improve performance and navigation when editing large forms, FormsByAir will now load section content on-demand, and only expand one section at a time by default.

This means that elements within each section will not be loaded until you click on them. You may notice the loading indicator appear while this is happening. Once loaded, sections will remain cached, but only one section will expand and display at a time.

A new button "Expand all sections" is available to load and display all sections at the same time if required.

This does not impact forms that don't use sections.

The form designer will also now validate items within an **Option List** or **Option Name/Value List** to ensure they are unique.
