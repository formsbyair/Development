title: Return Third Party Requests
type: platform
---

You can now **Return** a submitted Third Party Request where the requesting form is either **Saved** or in **Workflow** pre-authorisation.

This is particularly useful where third party requests include post-submit validation, which is only processed when the main requesting form is submitted.

When a third party request is re-submitted, and the main form is in workflow, the main form will automatically revalidate the data for that particular request.

Requests can be returned multiple times if required.
