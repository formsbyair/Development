For enhanced security, FormsByAir now supports Two Factor Authentication using the Google Authenticator app (available for iOS and Android)

Users can setup Two Factor Authentication as follows...

* Log in to the FormsByAir portal
* Click the button top-right and select **Change Password**
* Click the button **Setup Two Factor Authentication** and follow the instructions

Once enabled, users will be prompted for an additional verification code (provided by the app) when they log in.

Users with Two Factor Authentication enabled are tagged **2FA** in the **Manage Users** section of the portal.

We recommend that all users in the Administrator role enable Two Factor Authentication.
