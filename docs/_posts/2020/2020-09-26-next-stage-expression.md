title: Next Stage Expression
type: platform
---

When a form is configured for **Staged** submission, each submit will cause the form to either enter workflow for review, or revert to saved status for someone else to complete the next stage.

**Next Stage Expression** provides a mechanism to conditionally progress directly to the next stage where the expression evaluates to true.
