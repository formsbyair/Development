title: Mandatory third party requests
type: feature
---

Third party request elements can now be flagged as **Required** meaning a request must be generated for someone else to complete that part of the form. All elements within the request are read-only for the main form filler.

This is useful where third parties are required to check existing information and update it, or provide consent.
