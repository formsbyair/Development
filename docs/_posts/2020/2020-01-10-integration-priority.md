title: Integration priority
type: feature
---

You can now specify a **Priority** for delivery integrations such that all integrations with a higher priority will always be completed first.

This can be used in conjunction with the Document Delivery Reference tag, where a delivery reference from one integration is required for a subsequent integration - or where a particular integration should only be executed once all other integrations have been completed.
