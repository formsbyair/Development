title: Signature instructions

We've updated the instructions for Signature and Diagram elements (below). We previously checked for the presence of a touchscreen and displayed different instructions for mouse only devices, but this was confusing on devices with multiple display types. We also re-positioned the text above the signature box so it's visible while signing.

*Use your touchscreen or hold your mouse button down and move the pointer in the box below to sign*
