We've updated the instructions for Signature and Diagram elements as follows:

*Use your touchscreen or hold your mouse button down and move the pointer in the box below to sign*

We previously checked for the presence of a touch screen and displayed different instructions to mouse-based devices, but this was confusing on devices with multiple display types. We've also re-positioned this message above the signature box so it's visible while signing.
