title: Form Analytics
type: platform

We've added new per-form analytics to provide insights in to how form fillers and your team are using your forms including:

* Median completion time
* Drop outs per section
* Conversion Ratio
* Median time in workflow
* Return rate

Administrators can access form analytics by selecting Action > Analytics against a form in our portal.

In addition, we've renamed Documents > Analytics to Documents > Activity and added a click through to form analytics from here, which is available to everyone in the Operations role or higher.
