title: Form Analytics
type: platform

We've added new analytics to provide insights in to how form fillers and your team are using your forms including:

* Median completion time
* Drop outs per section
* Conversion Ratio
* Median time in workflow
* Return rate

Form analytics can be accessed in our portal by selecting Action > Analytics against a form.

As part of this change we've renamed Documents > Analytics to Documents > Activity. You can access analytics from here by clicking on a form.
