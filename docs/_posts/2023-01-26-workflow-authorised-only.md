title: Workflow Authorised Only
type: platform
---

We've added a new option **Authorised Only** for Workflow elements, which is available when **Requires Authorisation** has been enabled for a form.

Content within a Workflow element with this option enabled will only be displayed when a document's workflow status is **Authorized**

This may be useful where you have additional information that should only be captured once a form has been authorised.
