title: Prefill confirmation
type: platform
---

We'll now display a confirmation message instead of the normal share links when manually prefilling a form that includes an "On Request" email.

This may be useful where the prefiller of the form should not have access to the resulting document after it's been generated and sent to the person that needs to complete it.
