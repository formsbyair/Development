title: Email & Phone Number Validation
type: platform
---

Email domain validation messages have previously been displayed as passive warnings, which enabled users to continue if the validation of their domain was incorrect, but it also meant that many legitimate warnings were ignored.

In order to further improve data quality and minimize email bouncebacks, email validation messages will now appear as errors that must be resolved or dismissed by clicking "Ignore".

We have applied similar validation to phone numbers where **Format** is set to International. A validation error will be displayed if the number is invalid for a given Country, which must be resolved or dismissed by clicking "Ignore".
