title: CSV & Text From Template data formatting
type: fix
---

FormsByAir will no longer format form data in **CSV From Template** and **Text From Template** integrations, as these generally need to be machine rather than human readable files.

Note - Form data was already unformatted in *Batch* CSV and Text files, the change applies to files generated for individual submissions.
