title: New Portal
type: platform

Our new management portal is available to preview from today for all partner administrators.

Next time you log in you'll see an option at the top "Try New Portal" where you can enable it, and also switch back to the original portal if required.

Most features appear and operate the same as they did before, but with a fresher look, better performance, and more consistency.

Here is a detailed list of what has changed:

**General**

* Upgraded to the latest underlying browser frameworks including Angular 17.x and Bootstrap 5.3
* Updated WSYWIG HTML and template editor to TinyMCE
* Updated Code editor to the latest ACE Editor with syntax highlighting
* Workflow > Log menu moved to Documents menu
* All admin functions including Profile, Tables, Users and API keys moved to a single Administration menu
* All pages listing multiple items now include the ability to filter those items
* Unique identifiers for items are now hidden, replaced with a "Copy Id" menu option

**Form Builder**

* Replaced drag-and-drop with cut-and-paste for more accuracy when moving elements around
* Added Group/Ungroup options to easily move a block of elements
* Additional validation to check for issues when saving a form design

**Document View**

* Uses the same display engine as when you fill out a form for a more consistent view
* Workflow elements can now leverage the full range of form functionality, the previous Document View used a cut-down display engine
* Hidden formulas are hidden by default, but can be toggled on/off with a switch at the bottom of the page


Assuming all goes well we plan to continue the rollout as follows...

* Extend the opt-in preview to all portal users in a couple of weeks
* Make the new portal the default option in early March, but retain an opt-out
* Remove the opt-out option later in March
