We've added new triggers for email reminders as follows:

|**After Start**|Prompt users that may have abandonded a form to see if they need help. Requires **Auto Save** to be enabled for the form.|
|**In Workflow**|Keep track of documents that have been in workflow for an extended period of time by emailing the assignee or an administor.|
