title: Workflow Deauthorise
type: platform
---

You can now **Deauthorise** a document that has been authorised by selecting Options > Deauthorise in workflow.

This will move the document back to **Pending** status so it can be edited or returned to the form filler. It will also be re-assigned to either the user that requested authorisation (if any), or the user that authorised it.

The document will need to be re-authorised before it can be approved.
