title: Mandatory third party requests for staged forms
type: platform
---

We've updated [Mandatory third party requests for staged forms]({{ site.baseurl }}/changelog/#/2020/10/02/mandatory-third-party-requests-staged) so the original document will now be set to **Requesting** status when we generate and send the third party requests. This will prevent the original form filler from accessing the document while waiting for the requests to be submitted.
