FormsByAir will now check the version of existing documents when saving or submitting. If a user attempts to save or submit a document that has been updated outside of their current browser window they'll receive a warning message instructing them to *Reload* to get the latest version. FormsByAir will continue to display an error message if the document has already been submitted.

This may occur where:

* A request is updated in our portal (e.g. to correct a mistake) while the user has the form open in their browser
* An existing document is opened in multiple windows or on multiple devices at the same time
