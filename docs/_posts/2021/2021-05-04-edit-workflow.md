**Workflow** elements in FormsByAir are the "for office use only" equivalent of traditional forms. Content contained within a Workflow element is hidden from form users, and only available when a document is in Workflow status.

By default, workflow content can be edited directly in the portal where it is flagged with a blue background.

However, the Document viewer only supports basic form functionality like Text and Option questions. If you have more advanced requirements for workflow data capture, FormsByAir now offers the ability to edit workflow content like a regular form.

To enable this option, change the **Format** setting for your Workflow element from Workflow to Form. Workflow content in the Document viewer is then read-only, and a new **Edit Workflow** button will appear at the bottom of the page. Edit Workflow is available for any user in the Workflow role or higher. The existing **Edit** button will also appear for Administrators and Supervisors to edit submitted form data.

After clicking Edit Workflow we'll open the document for edit, but only render the content within your Workflow element. The data model for the whole form is available, so workflow content can reference anything in the rest of the form with tags as normal.

When you Save Changes we'll update your workflow content and return to the document viewer.
