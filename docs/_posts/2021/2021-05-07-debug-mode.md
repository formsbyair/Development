title: Debug mode

We've added a new **Debug** option to the portal for form **Administrators**. Forms opened in debug mode will display validation messages by default, but not enforce them, allowing navigation throughout the form. Prefill-only content and hidden formulas will also be visible.

Forms can't be saved or submitted in debug mode.
