title: Confirmation Type
type: platform

We've consolidated the form settings **Hide Form After Submit** and **Submit URL** in to a new setting "Confirmation Type" to better describe the behaviour of the form on submit. The options for this setting are as follows:

* Disable form and show confirmation message at the bottom of the page
* Hide form and show confirmation message at the top of the page
* Redirect to a custom confirmation page

**Return URL** is only available for the first two options, as this relates to redirection *after* a confirmation message has been displayed when a user clicks the "Close" or "X" buttons.
