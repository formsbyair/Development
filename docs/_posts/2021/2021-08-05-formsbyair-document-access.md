title: FormsByAir document access
type: platform
---

The foundation of our approach to security is that we don't keep form submission data. Form submissions are held temporarily during validation, workflow & delivery, and then permanently deleted subject to the Data Retention Period for your account.

Form data can be accessed via our portal and API while it's temporarily held by us. To limit access during this time, we've made a change so that FormsByAir staff only have access to metadata (the Information page in the portal) by default. If staff do need access to form data, for example, to diagnose an issue, they must now request access for a specific document, which is then logged with a comment.
