We've further extended [Mandatory third party requests for staged forms]({{ site.baseurl }}/changelog/#/2020/10/02/mandatory-third-party-requests-staged) to now support **multiple** stages with mandatory requests.

This may be useful where you need multiple sets of people to review or approve a document.
