title: Generate map for import
type: platform

FormsByAir can now generate maps for import integrations based on the current version of a form.

Click **Generate Map** while editing an Import integration to generate and download a map that you can use as the basis of a custom map.

Alternatively, FormsByAir will generate a map automatically when you import a data file for an integration that doesn't have a map, effectively providing a straight match on JSON property names and Tag names.
