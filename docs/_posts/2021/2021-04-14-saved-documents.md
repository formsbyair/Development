title: Saved documents
type: fix

We've updated the Documents > Saved page in the portal to display *all* saved documents for users in the **Workflow** role or higher. 

Previously it would filter out any documents that had been saved by a different FormsByAir user. This behaviour now only applies to users in the **User** role.
