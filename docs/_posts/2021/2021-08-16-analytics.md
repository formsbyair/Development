We've applied the following changes as part of an on-going effort to improve analytics within FormsByAir.

* We've renamed Documents &gt; Statistics to Documents &gt; Analytics in the portal.

* We now capture a "Start" event for blank forms after they've been open for 10 seconds, as we previously had no way to track forms that were opened, started, and then abandonded.

* "Started" and "Expired" statuses are now included in Documents > Analytics to provide information on the rate of completion.

We'll be expanding the Analytics section further in future to show statistics like "Average time to complete" and "drop off" sections for incomplete forms.

Forms can still be configured to log to a Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager account where you need to integrate with marketing campaigns for example.
