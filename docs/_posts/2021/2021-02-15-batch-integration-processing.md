title: Batch integration processing
type: platform
---

We've improved the user experience and information in the portal for **Import** and **Report** integrations as follows:

* The portal will now display a PROCESSING status next to an integration while it is actively running, and prevent further execution until the current process has completed
* If a process completes successfully the PROCESSING status will be removed
* You can view a log of previous executions by clicking Action > Log against an integration
* If a process fails the portal will display a CHECK status next to the integration, which you can click to display the log and associated error message
* A CHECK status will remain in place until the next successful execution, or the integration is disabled
