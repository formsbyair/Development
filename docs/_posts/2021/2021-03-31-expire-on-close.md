title: Expire on close
type: platform

**Requested** and **Saved** documents normally expire on a rolling basis as follows:

* 30 days (or as configured for form) after request was generated; or
* 30 days after last save

We've applied an update so that forms with a fixed **Close Date/Time** will now override this behaviour and requested/saved documents will remain active up until the form closes.
