We've updated our API for **Import** integrations so you can now include file attachments using a multipart/form-data request

For more information see our [Swagger Documentation](https://formsbyair.com/swagger/ui/index#/Subscriptions/Subscriptions_ImportData)

Note - multipart/form-data requests are only supported when importing data for a *single* document.
