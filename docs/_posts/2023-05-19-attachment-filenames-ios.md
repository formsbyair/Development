title: Attachment filenames on iOS
type: platform
---

We've updated the **Attachment** question type so that files attached with the **Take Photo** option on iOS are renamed from the default "image.jpg" to a unique filename e.g. "image20230519T125236.jpg" to avoid warnings about duplicate files.

This does not affect the attachment of existing image files.
