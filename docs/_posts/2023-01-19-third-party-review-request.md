title: Third Party Review Request
type: platform
---

We've extended the functionality of requests to support the mandatory review of a form before submit with a **user selectable third party**, for example, a financial adviser.

To enable, the request should be located at the end of the form with both **Required** and **Lock Form** selected.

The form will force the generation of a request before it can be submitted, and will then lock all content to ensure it can't be changed after review. The main form filler can **Cancel** the request if they need to make additional changes, or send the request to someone else.

Once the third party has completed their part the main form filler can then submit the form.

Forms needing review by a *specific* person or group should continue to use a mandatory third party request in a staged form.
