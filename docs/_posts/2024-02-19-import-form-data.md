Forms that contain a single, active **Import** integration will now include an Import option on the Forms page of the portal, allowing non-Administrators to import form data. This is available to all roles except Workflow.

The Import and Log options are still available for individual Import integrations on the Form Integrations page for Administrators.

We recommend you review the roles assigned to users that were only given Administrator access because they needed to import data, in most cases you should be able to reduce their access to a non-Administrator role.
