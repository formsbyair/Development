title: Disable save until start
type: platform
---

The **Save & Finish Later** button in all *blank* forms will now be disabled until the form is **started** (by entering data or making a selection in the form)

This does not apply to requested or previously saved forms.

Saving a blank form meant that any "On Start" integrations could be bypassed.
