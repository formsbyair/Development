title: Preview Mode
type: platform

We've added a new **Preview Mode** so you can quickly review all of a form's content without validation.

Forms can be opened in preview mode from our portal, or by adding a querystring parameter "preview=1" to the URL for any form.

Preview Mode does not require authentication, so can used with Published (Public) and Test (Public) forms.
