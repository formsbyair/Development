In order to quickly understand the current status of a document in workflow, we'll now display any comment associated with the last workflow action at the top of the **Document** page. Users can continue to see *all* workflow actions and comments on the **Information** page.

We've also added the following metrics to the Workflow section of our Analytics page:

* Workflow Rate  
* Approval Rate
* Throughput
