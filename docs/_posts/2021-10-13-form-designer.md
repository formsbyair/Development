title: Form designer improvements
type: platform
---

We've made a couple of changes to the form designer as follows:

* We've removed the "Advanced Settings" toggle so that all settings for the selected element are always displayed
* We now check that all integrations referenced by form elements exist for the form (in case they've been deleted, or you've copied form elements that reference integrations in another form)
