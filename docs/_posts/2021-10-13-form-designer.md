title: Form designer improvements
type: platform

We've made a couple of changes to the form designer as follows:

* We've removed the "Advanced Settings" toggle so that all settings for the selected element are always displayed
* We'll show a validation error on save for any elements referencing an integration that is not available. This may occur where you've copied form elements that reference integrations in other forms, or you've deleted an integration.
