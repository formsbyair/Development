title: Form designer improvements
type: platform

We've made a couple of changes to our form designer as follows:

* We've removed the "Advanced Settings" toggle so that all settings for the selected element are always displayed.
* We now check for missing integrations on form save. You may see this error if you've copied a form without integrations, or copied form elements without creating the corresponding integrations, or you've deleted an integration.
