We've updated our CDD & Investment form templates to accommodate these changes as follows:

* Capture constitution and shareholder agreement for companies. FormsByAir can automatically pull a Company Extract from MBIE, but these other documents will need to be manually attached
* Capture source of wealth for entities related to client e.g. a trust that owns more than 25% of a company
* Capture settlors and protectors for trusts
* Mandatory affirmation for entities that all relevant people have been included in the form
