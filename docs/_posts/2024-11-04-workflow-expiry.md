title: Workflow expiry
type: platform
---

As part of our data retention policy to minimise the time that form data is held in our system, we are planning to introduce rolling expiry to Workflow effective **1 December 2024**

The default workflow expiry period will be **60 days** but this can be adjusted per form between 10 and 90 days.

A **rolling expiry** means that the 60 day period will reset every time you take some action on a document e.g. reassign, comment, authorise, so it will never expire while you're actively working on it.

In addition, we're adding a **Snooze** function so you can hold a document in Workflow for a specific period of time if it can't be processed immediately. Snoozed documents will be hidden by default unless you specifically filter for them, and will reappear at the end of the snooze period, triggering the usual notifications.

We'll display the expiry date for all workflow documents in our portal and allow you to filter for documents that are expiring soon.

On expiry, our system will send an automated email notification to the assignee or team. The document can then be restored if necessary within the data retention period for your account.

You can continue to set custom reminder emails at any frequency for documents in Workflow.

We'll be in touch before this change goes live if you have a large number of documents in workflow older than 60 days so we can discuss options to bulk export or expire them.

We also plan to make the following related changes:

* Documents in **Requesting** status after 30 days will now automatically move to Workflow. You can continue to set custom reminders at any frequency for documents in Requesting status.

* The **Edited** workflow status will be retired, as this masks a document's true status, and we already record edits in the Workflow log
