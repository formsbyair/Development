title: Default Value validation
type: platform
---

We've updated our form builder to validate Default Values if an expression with <<tags>> has been entered.

For example, if you have a Text element and enter a Default Value of <<Name>> you'll receive an error *Set numeric question type/format or add quotes around tag*

This validation does not apply if the Default Value is a function or static value.
