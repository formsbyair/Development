title: Two factor authentication policy
type: platform
---

FormsByAir has offered *optional* two-factor authentication for our portal for some time. We've now added an account level setting so you can mandate that all logins must use two-factor authentication. Once enabled, users will be required to setup two-factor authentication next time they login.

In addition, some newer integrations require two-factor authentication for all logins regardless of this setting, for example Xero Practice Manager.
