title: Two factor authentication policy
type: platform
---

We've added a new account level setting for two-factor authentication so you can now make it mandatory for all of your users. Once enabled, users that haven't previously setup two-factor authentication will be prompted to do so the next time they login.

In addition, some newer integrations now require mandatory two-factor authentication regardless of this setting, for example Xero Practice Manager.
