title: Return document in requesting status
type: platform
---

We've updated our portal so users in the [Workflow role]({{ site.baseurl }}/account/roles/) or higher can now Return a document in Requesting status.

This may be useful where you need the form filler to add or remove verification requests without interrupting other outstanding verification requests.
