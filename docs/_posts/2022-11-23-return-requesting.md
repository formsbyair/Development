title: Return document in requesting status
type: platform
---

We've updated our portal so users in the [Workflow]({{ site.baseurl }}/account/roles/) role or higher can now Return a document in [Requesting]({{ site.baseurl }}/documents/status/) status.

This may be useful where you need the form filler to add or remove verification requests without interrupting other outstanding verification requests.
