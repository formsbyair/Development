We've consolidated the form options **Hide Form After Submit** and **Submit URL** in to a new setting "Confirmation Type" to better describe the resulting behaviour. The options for this setting are:

* Disable form and show confirmation message at the bottom of the page
* Hide form and show confirmation message at the top of the page
* Redirect to a custom confirmation page

Note - **Return URL** is only available for the first two options
