title: ID verification support
type: platform
---

We've made a couple of changes to help teams that are supporting ID verification requests:

* We'll now show a list of reasons for a **Check** status alongside the status indicator e.g. "Address Not Verified"

* A new "Copy Link" button will retrieve the unique link for pending ID verification requests. This may be useful where a form filler didn't receive the link via text or email.
