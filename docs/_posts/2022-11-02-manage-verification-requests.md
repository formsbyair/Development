title: Manage verification requests

We've added two new options to assist with outstanding verification requests:

**Cancel Request** is available for requests in **REQUESTING** status, and can be used where verification has been completed by some other means, or is no longer required. If there are no other outstanding requests the document will move on to workflow or delivery.

**New Request** is available for requests in **REQUESTING** or **FAIL** status, and will trigger a new request to be sent to the original recipient. This may be useful where a previous request has been lost, or the recipient has failed verification and they are willing/able to try again.
