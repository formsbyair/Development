title: Attachment File Types
type: platform
---

We've changed **Attachment** questions to filter for specific file types by default. The intent is to:

* Reduce the chance of us accepting and delivering potentially dangerous files
* Trigger conversion (automatic or manual) of HEIF and HEVC files on iOS & macOS devices, as these formats have limited support outside of Apple's ecosystem.

The default file types are listed below:

|Mime Type|
|---|
|application/pdf|
|application/msword|
|application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document|
|application/vnd.ms-excel|
|application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet|
|application/vnd.ms-powerpoint|
|application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation|
|text/plain|
|text/csv|
|image/jpeg|
|image/png|
|image/gif|
|audio/mpeg|
|video/mp4|
|video/mpeg|
|application/zip|
