title: Generate missing tags
type: platform

We've added a new form-level setting **Auto generate missing tags on save design** which is *disabled* by default.

When enabled, FormsByAir will automatically generate tag names (based on Title) for all questions that don't have a tag when you save the form.

This is useful if you're planning to include **all** form data in a data integration, for example, an auto generated JSON file.
