title: Hidden formula visibility
type: platform

Hidden formulas are now hidden by default when viewing a document in our new portal to reduce unnecessary "noise".

They can be toggled on/off with a switch at the bottom of the page, hidden formulas that are also set to **read-only** will remain hidden.
