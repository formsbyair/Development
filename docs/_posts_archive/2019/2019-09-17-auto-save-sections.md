title: Auto save completed sections
type: feature
---

Added new form level option to automatically save completed sections during form fill.

The purpose of this feature is to provide insight in to abandoned forms (those that have been started, but then closed without saving or submitting)

Form users will continue to receive a warning that their changes haven't been saved when abandoning a form, even if the form has been auto saved.

Save reminders are not sent for auto saved forms unless the form is explicitly saved.

Auto saved forms will appear in the Document Log with CREATED status.
