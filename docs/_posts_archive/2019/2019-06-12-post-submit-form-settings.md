* Added **Hide form after submit** setting to hide form content after a form has been submitted so only the confirmation message is displayed.

* Removed **Hide on submit** Display Text property, this is superseded by the **Hide form after submit** setting.

* Added **Submit Url** setting to redirect a form after submit, this can also be specified using a [Form System Parameter]({{ site.baseurl }}/forms/parameters/)

* The **Hide restart button after submit** setting is now enabled by default for new forms, as most forms aren't filled out multiple times in succession.
