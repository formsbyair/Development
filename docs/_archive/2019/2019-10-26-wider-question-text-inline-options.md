title: Wider Question text for Inline Options
type: feature
---

FormsByAir will now adjust the width of question text for **Inline Radio** and **Inline Toggle** Option questions based on the Width specified for the options.

For example, if the options are Yes and No and you set a Width of 2, the question text will occupy 10 columns. Question text is normally restricted to 4 columns.

This is useful for survey-type questions with larger descriptions, and a small set of available options or scores.
