Display static text and images in a form

#### Basic formatting

Use the toolbar in **Editor** view to make text Bold/Italic/Underline, and insert hyperlinks and images.

Images and hyperlinks can point to existing files on the internet, or an asset that's been uploaded for a form.

Hyperlinks and images can be edited by clicking on them and using the popup toolbar.

#### Bullet points and numbering

Use the following markdown-based syntax for bullet points and numbered lists. This will ensure they are formatted correctly in your form and output documents. 

\*(space)My bullet point  
(space)(space)\*(space)My indented bullet point  

1.(space)My numbered point  
b.(space)My numbered point  
iii.(space)My numbered point  
(space)(space)1.(space)My indented numbered point

HTML tags &lt;ul&gt; &lt;ol&gt; may render OK in your form but won't be translated correctly in output documents.

#### Advanced formatting

To apply custom formatting to Display Content, select the Style tab in the form designer and define a custom CSS class, for example:

&lt;style&gt;  
.my-class {  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: red;  
}  
&lt;style&gt;

Then use the **HTML** view for your Display Content to add a span including class name containing your text as follows:

&lt;span class=&quot;my-class&quot;&gt;My text&lt;/span&gt;


Advanced formatting or any HTML tags apart from those used for Basic formatting will not be rendered in output documents.
