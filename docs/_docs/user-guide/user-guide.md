FormsByAir Workflow
“Workflow” is an optional feature of the FormsByAir platform that can be used where form submissions need manual review and approval before delivery to external systems, often for compliance with internal processes or regulatory standards.
When enabled, workflow can apply to all submissions, or only those that meet certain criteria, for example, where the form filler is an “entity”, and you need to check that all people related to the entity have been captured in the form.
Submitted forms (documents) are automatically added to the workflow queue, and email notifications are sent to your team. Documents can be assigned to specific people based on rules that you define, or self-assigned. Managers can review the queue to ensure that documents are reviewed and processed in a timely manner, and re-assign as required.
